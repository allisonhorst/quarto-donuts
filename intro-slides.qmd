## A brief history

-   **1995**: Official R release (programming language for statistical computing & graphics)

-   **2009:** JJ Allaire founds RStudio (company)

-   **2011:** RStudio IDE announced (integrated development environment for R)

-   **\~2013:** R Markdown - a computational notebook widely adopted by R users, eventually extended to an ecosystem of packages for all kinds of publishing

-   **2022:** Quarto officially enters the scene (and RStudio becomes [Posit](https://www.rstudio.com/tags/posit/))

## Why Quarto?

JJ Allaire (RStudio / Posit CEO & Quarto creator), [*Announcing Quarto*](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/):

> "...R Markdown is fundamentally tied to R, which severely limits the number of practitioners it can benefit, Quarto is RStudio's attempt to bring R Markdown to everyone! \[...\] **Quarto was designed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia,** with the idea that it will work even for languages that don't yet exist."

## So...what is it?

> ### Quarto^®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

We're going to talk about it in one way: Quarto documents (.qmd) as computational notebooks that support multiple languages and outputs (slides, PDF, Word, websites, books, etc.).

***Note:** I'm introducing Quarto as a **user** (I have ideas about what it does), not as a **developer** (I have very few ideas about how it works)*
